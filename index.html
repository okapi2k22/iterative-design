                <p class="text-body">Deall is an online curated job portal. Deall aims to make job searching 21x faster for both employers and job seekers.</p> 
                <p class="text-body">Deall makes job hiring process easy for employers by exposing them to only a select group of applicants. At the same time, Deall makes the job search process easy for job seekers by allowing them to batch apply to multiple companies.</p>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-body">Our team was inspired by Deall's vision as all of our members could identify with the painful process of job searching.</p>
                <p class="text-body">As a result, we decided to design our own version of Deall.</p> 
                <p class="text-body">We followed an iterative design process by first creating multiple low-fidelity sketches. By responding to user feedback, we iterated until we reached a single high-fidelity solution.</p>

                   <figcaption class="text-body">An overview of our iterative design process. We started with multiple sketches of different design options. We then created multiple low-fidelity design solutions. After, we developed a high-fidelity prototype that combined the ideas of the low-fidelity design ideas. Finally, we iterated on the high-fidelity prototype using feedback informed from a studio critique and from online user testing.</figcaption>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Pre-Design Thinking</h3>
                <p class="text-body">The first step in our process was to define the scope of our design. Due to time limitations, we decided to limit our interface design for desktop screens. We also limited our interface design to only include the perspective of job seekers as we could more easily identify with their pain points.</p>

                <p class="text-body">The second step in our journey was to develop rough sketches of 4 separate design solutions.</p>

Our third idea presented the job seeker's demographic information at the top, and on the bottom the job seeker's experience with an aside for extra information. Lastly, our fourth idea presented the job seeker's demographic information as an aside, and the job seeker's experience as vertically scrollable card list.</figcaption>

                <p class="text-body">We conducted user tests by making users perform a pre-defined task on our high-fidelity prototype. We asked users to apply to a pre-defined job role.</p>
                <p class="text-body">After conducting 3 user tests, we found that all users were able to successly complete their task. As a result, our high-fidelity prototype was efficient, learnable, and memorable.</p>
