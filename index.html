                <p class="text-body">Deall is an online curated job portal. Deall aims to make job searching 21x faster for both employers and job seekers.</p> 
                <p class="text-body">Deall makes job hiring process easy for employers by exposing them to only a select group of applicants. At the same time, Deall makes the job search process easy for job seekers by allowing them to batch apply to multiple companies.</p>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-body">Our team was inspired by Deall's vision as all of our members could identify with the painful process of job searching.</p>
                <p class="text-body">As a result, we decided to design our own version of Deall.</p> 
                <p class="text-body">We followed an iterative design process by first creating multiple low-fidelity sketches. By responding to user feedback, we iterated until we reached a single high-fidelity solution.</p>

                   <figcaption class="text-body">An overview of our iterative design process. We started with multiple sketches of different design options. We then created multiple low-fidelity design solutions. After, we developed a high-fidelity prototype that combined the ideas of the low-fidelity design ideas. Finally, we iterated on the high-fidelity prototype using feedback informed from a studio critique and from online user testing.</figcaption>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Pre-Design Thinking</h3>
                <p class="text-body">The first step in our process was to define the scope of our design. Due to time limitations, we decided to limit our interface design for desktop screens. We also limited our interface design to only include the perspective of job seekers as we could more easily identify with their pain points.</p>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Initial Sketches</h3>
                <p class="text-body">The second step in our journey was to develop rough sketches of 4 separate design solutions.</p>

                   <figcaption class="text-body">These are the 4 initial design ideas for our home page. Our first idea presented different jobs through horizontally-scrollable lists. Our second idea presented different jobs using an icon gallery. Our third idea presented different jobs through vertically-scrollable lists. Lastly, our fourth idea presented different jobs through a sidebar.</figcaption>

                   <figcaption class="text-body">These are the 4 initial design ideas for our job page. Our first idea presented a full-screen view of the job description. Our second idea presented job descriptions through a horizontal carousel. Our third idea presented job descriptions through a vertical "rollodex" view. Lastly, our fourth idea presented a main job description and an aside of similar jobs.</figcaption>

                   <figcaption class="text-body">These are the 4 initial design ideas for our profile page. Our first idea presented a full-screen view of the job seeker's profile with their avatar image. Our second idea presented the job seeker's demographic information at the top, and their experience in a horizontal card-based format contained under a dropdown. Our third idea presented the job seeker's demographic information at the top, and on the bottom the job seeker's experience with an aside for extra information. Lastly, our fourth idea presented the job seeker's demographic information as an aside, and the job seeker's experience as vertically scrollable card list.</figcaption>

                <p class="text-body">The third step in our process was to combine the ideas of our sketches into a single, low-fidelity wireframe.</p>

                <h3 class="text-header-5">Interactive High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                <p class="text-body">The fourth step in our process was to convert our low-fidelity wireframe into a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
                <p class="text-body">After presenting our high-fidelity prototype in a mock-crit studio, we identified several usability problems with navigation on our site and with displaying the internal state to the user.<p> 
                <p class="text-body">As a result, we added several Back buttons so users could return back to a previous page. We also confirmation messages to indicate to the user that they've successfully applied to a job.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 class="text-header-5">User Testing</h3>
                <p class="text-body">The final step in our process was to expose our high-fidelity design in front of real users by using <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">User Testing</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-body">We conducted user tests by making users perform a pre-defined task on our high-fidelity prototype. We asked users to apply to a pre-defined job role.</p>
                <p class="text-body">After conducting 3 user tests, we found that all users were able to successly complete their task.</p>
                <p class="text-body">Users said they liked the simplicity of the site. It allowed them to quickly and intuitively apply for jobs they liked. They also commented that they liked the clean interface and the easily nativation through different screens and functionalities.</p>
                <p class="text-body">Some participants reported that the simplicity of the interface was also a weakness because the interface lacked advanced filtering and sorting features.</p>
